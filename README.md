# Image Recognition with Deep Neural Networks
The repository contains various neural network architectures created on Tensorflow for the image classification task on CIFAR-10/100 dataset. 

Simple_Deep_NN py notebooks contain shallow neural networks with a plethora of experiments on different simple architectures such as Batch Normalization, Dropout and L2 regularization. The aim of the experiments as to find an optimal architecture using only simple feedforward neural networks. All of the experiments are followed by error and accuracy graphs. At the end the final model was tuned followed by its confusion matrix.
